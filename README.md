## Project Info:

Our project is a prototyped mobile-app solution for the maximum package volume problem for PVDs(personal vehicle drivers) and their vehicles. The frontend interface can be seen in Hackathon 2023.png file within the Figma Assets file. A PVD is able to download the app and login with their employee credentials. From there, they are directed to the home page where they can view their registered vehicles and have the ability to calculate what packages are available for pick-up. The calculate option provides a list of packages with their unique ID which the user can view, where these packages are assigned through the user's selected available vehicle space. The user is also able to register new vehicles within the app. 

A back-end logic also exists to showcase the package assignment process to a specific driver. The back-end folder contains mock databases for employees, vehicles, packages and package-types (varrying lengths and sizes) as well as logic for utilizing this mock data. Upon user input of their employee ID, the user is given the specific package IDs and total number of packages that they are assigned to deliver. From there, the mock package database is updated to show that the packages have been assigned so that all available packages are eventually assigned through repeated runs with different driver IDs. There is also the ability to register new users which would then be added to the mock database.
